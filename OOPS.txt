OOPS



Access Modifier: Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers: 

public: Accessible in all classes in your application.

protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es) (including subclasses declared outside the package).

private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.

default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within the same class and package within which its class is defined.


There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure Object Oriented. They are:

Encapsulation/Data Hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
All predefined types are objects
All user defined types are objects
All operations performed on objects must be only through methods exposed at the objects.
